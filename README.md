# My first Kaggle comp learning path
* Beginner transmits to beginners.
* collection of commented scripts showing what I have actually learned.
* To make it into a documentary, I might comment back on previously written stuff, but I will NEVER delete any piece of errors which are gonna appear here.

## My initial plan
1. Before even trying any deep learning games I will write my own rudimentary model including the underlying algos
2. One day I might submit it against the comp data. That is going to be my benchmark
3. Only then I start to deploy tens of crazy AI models running all night on my laptop.
  * If get that far, I might be technically breaking the comp rules of public sharing of code outside of Kaggle, but at this point I consider it very improbable:)

## List of scripts so far
1. 01_label_img_dfs_recursion.py
    * surprise that beautiful recursion DFS will not work for 4k x 4k images
2. 02_label_img_dfs_iterative.py
    * Changing the algo to iterative version.
    * TODO: I should time things, but pressure of too far-away goal says f... it.
